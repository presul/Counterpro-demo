# TODO: Fix Stats and Remove Live Demo Button

## Phase 1: Remove Button
- [x] Remove "See Revenue Impact Live" button from hero section
- [x] Keep only "Watch 3-Minute Demo" button

## Phase 2: Add Asterisks and Disclaimer
- [x] Add asterisk to +34% stat (already present)
- [x] Add asterisk to +$127 stat (already present)
- [x] Add asterisk to -89% stat (already present)
- [x] Add "*Your results will vary" disclaimer at bottom of Why CounterPro section (already present)

## Phase 3: Fix Alignment
- [x] Align small stat bubbles inside big cards properly (already correctly aligned with mx-auto, text-center, mt-auto)
- [x] Ensure consistent spacing and centering (all cards use flex flex-col with proper centering)

## Phase 4: Testing
- [x] Test all changes in browser (verified: button removed, asterisks present, disclaimer visible, alignment correct)
- [ ] Create checkpoint
