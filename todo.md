# TODO: Redesign Electron Animation

## Phase 1: Update Animation
- [x] Change electron particles from soft bubbles to sharp electric particles (2px, brighter)
- [x] Add electric trail/glow effects (::after pseudo-element with gradient trail)
- [x] Make particles move faster and more erratically (like electricity) (linear animation, no easing)
- [x] Add brightness/intensity variations (filter: brightness with keyframes)
- [x] Make particles flow through the holographic assistant and environment (diagonal paths)

## Phase 2: Testing
- [x] Test animation in browser
- [ ] Create checkpoint
